A framework for rapid development of enterprise-ready reactive web & mobile applications "to spec"

http://www.conarrative.com/glujs


GluJS is a framework for the test-driven development of reactive applications
leveraging rich javascript widget libraries.

Currently we have adapters with basic support for Ext JS 3.1+ and Ext JS 4.06+, an experimental adapter
for Sencha Touch and we'll soon be doing Titanium.

Installation
------------

 1. Unzip this package into a glujs folder (we'll call this the root directory)
 2. MAKE SURE YOU ARE CORRECTLY LICENSED FOR YOUR USE OF SENCHA LIBRARIES(http://www.sencha.com)
 3. Download the ExtJS 4.1 library and unzip the contents into the root/lib/extjs-4.x folder
    (bootstrap.js should be immediately in that location).
 4. TO RUN EXAMPLES: In a browser, open the index.html file located in the example of your choice.
    GluJS' emulation framework will allow the AJAX calls to work even when loading from the local filesystem.
 5. TO TEST EXAMPLES: In a browser open the spec/runner.html file located in the example of your choice.
 6. Enjoy using GluJS (http://www.conarrative.com/glujs).
